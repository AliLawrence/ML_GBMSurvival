Accurate And Meaningful Prediction Models Can Be Generated From Imbalanced Data Using Machine Learning: A High Grade Glioma Prediction Model For Greater Than Median Survival.

This is the code used to create prediction models for grade IV CNS tumours using SMOTE analysis for both logistic regression and random forest methods of analysis. 
The data set provided in this repository contains an abridged number of patients (The first 50 patients) but should allow for replication of the results generated by our research department.

Ethical approval for this research study was granted by the Human Biology Research Ethics Committee (19/HRA/1828). Consent was not required as the data used was retrospective clinical record information collected as part of routine care and all data used was fully anonymised.
